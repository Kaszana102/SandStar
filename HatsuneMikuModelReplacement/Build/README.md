New outside enemy, a SandStar which buries itself in the ground, and loves being in a group.

## Overview

Mod which adds new Enemy. It buries itself in the ground, and will try to keep in touch with its peers. Whenever threatened, it will jump out of the ground and fly towards player to pierce him through. It's not dangerous on its own, but a bigger group can be deadly!

## For future

## Sounds
Sounds may be heard from too far. That part is still in testing.
